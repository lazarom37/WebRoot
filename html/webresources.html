  <a href="https://validator.w3.org">w3 HTML Validator</a><br />
  Site that checks the syntax of your HTML code<br />
  HTML generally doesn't mind if you make egregious errors on 
  your own, but when other browsers and attached script files are 
  thrown into the mix it can create some "invisible" errors that 
  your IDE wouldn't be able to find. w3's HTML Validator is a certified 
  and reputable service that helps find unaccounted errors organized 
  line-by-line on suggestions for a fix. <br />
